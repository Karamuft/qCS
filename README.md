# General Info
- qCS is a tool to analyze and alter component values of superconducting logic cells such as RSFQ and AQFP cells. It also helps generating critical margin/yield-optimized variants of designed cells by utilizing the following built-in capabilities such as critical margin calculation, parametric yield analysis and critical margin range optimization.

# Requirements:
- MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) 9.11: The qCS installer will automatically download MCR from Mathworks website. If it is already installed, the system will detect the installed path (Windows OS only). Minimum 2 GB of disk capacity is required to accommodate MCR installation. Any installation directory is permitted for MCR.
- Create a parent folder for qCS installation directory since qCS deletes its parent folder upon uninstallation.

# Setup:
- All instructions related to the installation and permissions are provided in the README file within the release.

# License:
- Refer to the LICENSE information on the qCS user interface.
